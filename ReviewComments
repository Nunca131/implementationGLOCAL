1. Another main concern is the following: when it is about multiplelocal alignment, due to the tractability issues, in the literature it ismandatory to execute some filtering step. Especially in this case, headsand tails of sequences might be quickly removed at start, as well as a huge portion of the whole input, gaining a lot of computation time. Authors should include this in the discussion and consider to add a filtering step to their software. There are lossless filters (e.g. Peterlongo et al. Lossless filter for multiple repeats with bounded edit distance. Algorithms for Molecular Biology 4 (2009)) that guarantee not toremove real high quality alignments. For the case of Hamming distance youcan look up the following instead: Peterlongo et al. Lossless filter formultiple repetitions with Hamming distance. J. Discrete Algorithms 6(3):497-509, 2008. 


2. Introduction:"usually gapless patterns". This is not true: if you do not allow gaps,then there is no point to use dynamic programming (DP) and quadratic algorithms. When you use DP it means that you allow insertions anddeletions.

Footprinter is an exact DP algorithm. We have slightly extended the
discussion to make clear that only approximately matching gapless
substrings are considered. 


3. The presentation of the tool is reduced, and I wonder why the authors didn’t include a link to the source code, or to a jar file, so that results can be replicated..”

4.References are some what unbalanced.

Many of the references refer to key theoretical results on the alignment
that are more than a decade old. We are not aware references adding to
(or consolidating) this work. Somewhat surprisingly, there does not seem to
be a good book covering most of the theory that could be cited instead.
We have added several very recent references on state of the art MSA tools.

*** TODO: these references will be included ***
