1. Another main concern is the following: when it is about multiplelocal alignment, due to the tractability issues, in the literature it ismandatory to execute some filtering step. Especially in this case, headsand tails of sequences might be quickly removed at start, as well as a huge portion of the whole input, gaining a lot of computation time. Authors should include this in the discussion and consider to add a filtering step to their software. There are lossless filters (e.g. Peterlongo et al. Lossless filter for multiple repeats with bounded edit distance. Algorithms for Molecular Biology 4 (2009)) that guarantee not toremove real high quality alignments. For the case of Hamming distance youcan look up the following instead: Peterlongo et al. Lossless filter formultiple repetitions with Hamming distance. J. Discrete Algorithms 6(3):497-509, 2008. 


2. Introduction:"usually gapless patterns". This is not true: if you do not allow gaps,then there is no point to use dynamic programming (DP) and quadratic algorithms. When you use DP it means that you allow insertions anddeletions.

3. The presentation of the tool is reduced, and I wonder why the authors didn’t include a link to the source code, or to a jar file, so that results can be replicated..”

4.References are somewhatunbalanced. With the exception of (Retzlaff and Stadler, 2018), (Baichooand Ouzounis, 2017), (Schirmer and Giegerich, 2013) and three morereferences from the circle of P. F. Stadler (2015, 2017, 2011) the rest ofthe references are dated 2010 or before. Some more references (possiblyout of P. F. Stadler's circle) covering the last five years would make themanuscript more attractive in an updated context. Notice that 33references are cited and that most of them do not add value to themanuscript in terms of timeliness.
